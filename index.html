    <h2> Introduction to the Internet</h2>
    <p>This section delves into the core components and workings of the internet</p>

    <h3> * Purpose of the Internet</h3>
    <p>The internet is explained as a global network for communication and data exchange between various devices.</p>
    <h3>* IP Address(Internet protocol)</h3>
    <p>An IP(Internet protocol) address is defined as a unique identifier for devices on the internet, same as a physical address for mail delivery.</p>
    <h3>* Internet Service Provider (ISP):</h3>
    <p>The role of an ISP is to assign temporary IP addresses to devices upon connection to the internet.</p>
    <h3>* DNS (Domain Name System):</h3>
    <p>DNS servers translate human-friendly domain names (e.g., "google.com") into machine-readable IP addresses.</p>
    <h3>* MAC Address(Media Access Control Address):</h3>
    <p>The MAC address is introduced as a permanent, physical address for a device, which is essential for secure data transmission.</p>
    <p>Single device can have multiple MAC addresses.</p>
    <h3>* Port Number:</h3>
    <p> The function of port numbers in directing data to the correct application or tab within a device. There are different port numbers.</p>
    <h3> * HTTP vs HTTPS:</h3> 
    <p> The distinction between the insecure HTTP and the secure, encrypted HTTPS protocols are refered for data transfer.</p>

    <h2>Networking Fundamentals</h2>
    <h3>* Data Transfer Methods:</h3>
    <p>The evolution of data transfer methods is starting from basic solutions like USB drives and direct cabling to more scalable networking solutions.</p>
    <h3>* Switches and Local Area Network (LAN):</h3>
    <p>How switches are used to create local networks, enabling communication between devices within a limited area.</p>
    <h3>* Routers:</h3>
    <p>The function of routers in connecting different local networks to form the global internet. The concept of routers incorporating switches and Wireless Access Control (WAC).</p>
    <h3>* Submarine Cables:</h3>
    <p>The role of submarine cables is to connect continents.</p>
    <h3>* Public vs Private IP Addresses:</h3>
    <p>The difference between globally unique public IP addresses and locally unique private IP addresses, and the reasons forthe introduction of private IP addresses.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to Web Development</h2>
    <p>The fundamental concepts of web development:</p>
    <h3>* Client-Server Architecture:</h3>
    <p>The basic model of a client and server.</p>
    <h3>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The three core technologies of the web are introduced with practical examples demonstrating their roles:</h3>
    <p>* HTML: For structuring the content of a webpage.</p>
    <p>* CSS : For styling and visual presentation.</p>
    <p>* JavaScript : For adding interactivity and logic to a webpage.</p>
    <h3>* Full-Stack Development (MERN Stack):</h3>
    <p>* Front-End : Technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for building the user interfaces.</p>
    <p>* Back-End : The server-side logic and business rules are explained, with Node.js,Express.js and Spring Boot. The importance of the back-end for security and implementing business logic.</p>
    <p>* Database : MongoDB is a database for storing data.</p>
    <p>* Roles : The roles of a Front-End Developer, Back-End Developer, and Full-Stack Developer .</p>
