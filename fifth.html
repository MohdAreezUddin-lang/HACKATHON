    <h2>Building a Website with Many Pages 📄➡📄</h2>
    <p>Websites aren't just one page. Here's how to connect them:</p>
    <h3>* Create Multiple Files:</h3>
    <p> Make a separate HTML file for each page, like home.html, about.html, and contact.html.</p>
    <h3>* Link Them Together:</h3>
    <p> Use the anchor (a) tag to create clickable links. This is how you build a navigation menu so people can jump from one page to another. 🔗</p>
    <h3>* Keep a Consistent Structure:</h3>
    <p>Use (header) for the top menu, (main) for the content, and (footer) for the bottom part on every page so your site looks organized. 🏛</p>

    <h2>Putting Your Website Online! 🚀</h2>
    <p>Ready to share your creation with the world? You can "deploy" it for free!</p>
    <h3>* What is Deploying?</h3>
    <p> It's just a fancy word for uploading your website files to a server so anyone can visit it with a link.</p>
    <h3>* Using Netlify:</h3>
    <p>A popular free service where you can drag and drop your website folder.</p>
    <h3> * Go Live:</h3>
    <p> Netlify will give you a live link (like your-project.netlify.app) that you can share with anyone, anywhere! 🌐</p>
